					When you smoke, so does your baby. There is no safe level of smoking, either for you or your baby.
					Smoking during pregnancy exposes your unborn baby to over 4,000 chemicals contained in cigarette
					smoke.
					If you smoke, protecting your baby from tobacco smoke is one of the best things you can do to give
					your
					child a healthy start in life.
					Smoking while you're pregnant can cause problems for both you and your baby.

					There is no safe amount of smoking during pregnancy. Cigarettes and vapes contain nicotine and many
					other chemicals,
					which are health risks for pregnant women and babies. Although vaping is suggested as an alternative
					for those who
					are already smoking, stopping smoking or vaping while pregnant has large benefits for mothers and
					children.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Smoking during pregnancy can lead to these risks for mothers </b>
					<ul>
						<li>miscarriage</li>
						<li>the fetus developing outside the womb (ectopic pregnancy)</li>
						<li>bleeding in the last month of pregnancy, with serious risks for the mother and baby</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Risks for the baby </b>
					<ul>
						<li>being born prematurely, less than 37 weeks' gestation</li>
						<li>lower birth weights </li>
						<li>Stillbirth</li>
						<li>being born with problems such as asthma, glue ear, cleft lip or palate</li>
					</ul>
					Not all effects of smoking and other drug use observed in mothers and babies is due to smoking
					alone.
					Smoking and misuse of alcohol or illicit drugs worldwide is associated with inadequate prenatal
					care, poor nutrition,
					poverty, mental illness, a history of sexual or physical abuse.
					<br>
					<br>
					Children exposed to smoking and other drugs during pregnancy are also likely to be exposed to a home
					where there are similar risks.
					These risks will further impact healthy development and wellbeing.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>
						It is never too late to reduce the risks of alcohol and other drug use for you and your baby, so
						talk to someone…your whānau,
						your midwife, or your doctor. For information on where to get further help here are some links.

					All recreational drugs, including smoking, taken during pregnancy can pass to the baby.
					Depending on the kinds of drugs used, how much and how often and when they are used, they can harm
					the baby's brain and organs.

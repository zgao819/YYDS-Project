                    Methamphetamine, commonly known as meth, is a potent and highly addictive stimulant that significantly
                    harms both physical
                    and mental health. Physically, it can cause severe cardiovascular issues, neurological damage, rapid and
                    unhealthy weight loss,
                    and dental problems often referred to as “meth mouth.” Chronic use also leads to skin sores and a
                    prematurely aged appearance.
                    Mentally, methamphetamine can result in intense addiction, paranoia, psychosis, mood disorders, and
                    violent or risky behavior.
                    The social consequences are equally devastating, often leading to strained relationships, financial and
                    legal issues,
                    and an inability to maintain employment or daily responsibilities. Meth’s effects make it a highly
                    dangerous substance
                    with a challenging path to recovery.

                <ul>
                  <li>preeclampsia or pregnancy related high blood pressure </li>
                  <li>placental abruption – or placenta coming away from the womb early  </li>

                <b>Exposure to methamphetamine can lead to ongoing developmental problems</b>

                Not all effects of methamphetamine and other drug use observed in mothers and babies is due to methamphetamine use alone.
                Misuse of maternal methamphetamine or other drugs worldwide is associated with inadequate prenatal care, poor nutrition, poverty,
                mental illness, a history of sexual or physical abuse.
                <br>
                <br>
                Children exposed to methamphetamine and other drugs during pregnancy are also likely to be exposed to a home where there are similar risks.
                These risks will further impact healthy development and wellbeing.

                All recreational drugs, including smoking, taken during pregnancy can pass to the baby.
                Depending on the kinds of drugs used, how much and how often and when they are used, they can harm the baby's brain and organs.

          Cannabis can have several potential harms, particularly with heavy, frequent, or prolonged use.
          The risks associated with cannabis are influenced by various factors,
          including the method of consumption, the potency of THC, individual susceptibility, and the age at which use
          begins.

          There is no known safe use of cannabis during pregnancy. Increased social acceptability of its use,
          the perception that it is safe, and reports that it reduces nausea and depression has increased use.
          THC the active ingredient in cannabis is stronger now and cannabis is available in a variety of forms such as
          candies,
          drinks, suppositories, snacks, lollipops and capsules. This has resulted in more women using it, at a great
          frequency and at a higher strength.

          <b>Using large amounts of cannabis or more frequently can lead to these risks for mothers </b>
          <ul>
            <li>preeclampsia or pregnancy related high blood pressure </li>
            <li>placental abruption or placenta coming away from the womb early </li>
            <li>gestational weight gains greater that recommended for a healthy pregnancy </li>
            <li>overall poor health </li>

          </ul>
          Not all effects of cannabis and other drug use observed in mothers and babies is due to cannabis use alone.
          Misuse of maternal cannabis or illicit drugs worldwide is associated with inadequate prenatal care, poor
          nutrition, poverty, mental illness,
          a history of sexual or physical abuse.
          <br>
          <br>
          Children exposed to cannabis and other drugs during pregnancy are also likely to be exposed to a home where
          there are similar risks.
          These risks will further impact healthy development and wellbeing.

          All recreational drugs, including smoking, taken during pregnancy can pass to the baby.
          Depending on the kinds of drugs used, how much and how often and when they are used, they can harm the baby's
          brain and organs.

					<li><b>MDMA (ecstacy)</b></li>
					MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy or "Molly," is a synthetic drug that acts as both a stimulant and a hallucinogen.
					While it can produce feelings of euphoria, emotional closeness, and increased energy,
					MDMA also carries several significant health risks, particularly when used recreationally.
					<li><b>Cocaine (coke, crack) </b></li>
					Cocaine, commonly referred to as "coke" in its powdered form or "crack" in its crystallized form,
					is a powerful and highly addictive stimulant drug derived from the coca plant.
					It is often used recreationally for its intense, short-term euphoric effects.
					However, cocaine poses numerous significant health risks, particularly due to its addictive potential and harmful impact on the body and brain.
					<li><b>Ketamine </b></li>
					Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used medically for anesthesia, pain relief, and, more recently, as a treatment for depression.
					However, it is also used recreationally due to its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects, sometimes referred to as “Special K.”
					While it has legitimate therapeutic uses, recreational ketamine use can lead to various harmful effects and potential risks.
					<li><b>LSD or mushrooms </b></li>
					LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) and psilocybin mushrooms are classic psychedelics known for their hallucinogenic effects.
					Both substances are used recreationally for their ability to alter perception, mood, and thought processes,
					and they’re sometimes used therapeutically in clinical settings for mental health conditions.
					However, both can carry risks, particularly when used without medical supervision.
					<li><b>Benzodiazapines (benzos, Valium, Temazepam etc) </b></li>
					Benzodiazepines (often called "benzos") are a class of medications that are commonly prescribed to treat anxiety,
					insomnia, muscle spasms, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Popular benzos include Valium (diazepam), Temazepam, Xanax (alprazolam),
					and Ativan (lorazepam). While effective for short-term use, benzos pose significant risks, particularly when used long-term, recreationally,
					or in combination with other substances.
					<li><b>Amphetamine or stimulants that haven’t been prescribed by your doctor (speed, Ritalin, Concerta, Rubifen, dexamphetamine, atomoxetine, Strattera) </b></li>
					Amphetamines and other stimulants—such as speed, Ritalin (methylphenidate), Concerta, Rubifen, dexamphetamine, atomoxetine, and Strattera—are prescription medications typically used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.
					While these medications can be safe and effective when used as prescribed by a doctor, non-prescribed or recreational use carries significant risks.
					<li><b>GHB/GBL (G, liquid ecstasy) </b></li>
					GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) and GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) are central nervous system depressants commonly associated with recreational use,
					often referred to as "G" or "liquid ecstasy." While GHB has been used in medical settings for conditions such as narcolepsy and
					as a general anesthetic, the non-prescribed use of GHB and GBL poses significant risks.
					<li><b>Heroin or other opiates (morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, tramadol, oxycodone, oxy, codeine) </b></li>
					Heroin and other opiates, including morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, tramadol, oxycodone, and codeine,
					are powerful substances that can be effective for pain management when used under medical supervision.
					However, non-medical use or misuse of these drugs can lead to severe physical and psychological harm.
					<li><b>Synthetic cannabinoids (spice, kronic, synnies) </b></li>
					Synthetic cannabinoids, commonly known by names such as Spice, Kronic, or Synnies, are a group of man-made chemicals that mimic
					the effects of THC, the active component of cannabis. These substances are often sprayed onto plant material and marketed as legal
					alternatives to marijuana. However, synthetic cannabinoids can be significantly more potent and unpredictable than natural cannabis,
					leading to a range of harmful effects.
					<li><b>Synthetic cathinones (bath salts, m-cat [mephedrone], flakka [alpha-pvp] </b></li>
					Synthetic cathinones, commonly referred to as "bath salts," "m-cat" (mephedrone), and "flakka" (alpha-PVP),
					are a group of substances that mimic the effects of stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines. These compounds are chemically similar to cathinone,
					a natural stimulant found in the khat plant. Although they are often sold as legal alternatives,
					synthetic cathinones can pose significant health risks and dangers.

                    If you are pregnant or planning on a pregnancy not drinking alcohol is the safest option.
                    During pregnancy, alcohol can be transferred to your baby through the placenta and umbilical cord
                    affecting your pēpi's development.
                    Drinking during pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink, the greater
                    the risk.

                There is no safe amount or time for pregnant or breastfeeding women to drink alcohol.
                Binge drinking which is 4 or more drinks within 2 hours or chronic heavy drinking which is 3 or more drinks per day can cause the most harm.

                <b>Risks for the baby </b>
                <ul>
                  <li>being born prematurely, less than 37 weeks' gestation </li>
                  <li>the baby may be still born </li>
                  <li>weighing less at birth, or being smaller overall </li>

                Not all effects of alcohol and other drug use observed in mothers and babies are due to alcohol use alone.
                Misuse of maternal alcohol or illicit drugs worldwide is associated with inadequate prenatal care, poor nutrition,
                poverty, mental illness, a history of sexual or physical abuse.<br>
                <br>
                Children exposed to alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy are also likely to be exposed to a home where there are similar risks.
                These risks will further impact healthy development and wellbeing.

                All recreational drugs, including smoking, taken during pregnancy can pass to the baby.
                Depending on the kinds of drugs used, how much and how often and when they are used, they can harm the baby's brain and organs.
